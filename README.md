Usage
====

Serve this up somewhere and go to index.html
If you have python, it is as easy as navigating to this directory and running 

  > `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

and then going to `http://localhost:8000/` in your Web Audio enabled browser (CHROME/CHROMIUM)
Try to keep your d00ds alive!

Bugs
====

Lots :)  Did I mention this was my first coffeescript project?  And my first canvas project?  And my first html5 audio project?
Will not run in Firefox, Safari.

fun times!
